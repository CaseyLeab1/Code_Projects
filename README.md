# Introduction 
This is a python program that takes a list of files available at a AWS s3 url and transforms the web traffic data within each CSV file so that it aggregates and returns the data to 1 new CSV file containing 
each user, the website path visited, and how many times that user visited that website path


# Getting Started
Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. 
1.	Download the project to any local folder. Open the python project in a python code editor and ensure python is installed and running on your computer. 

2.	Required Software:python and a python code editor

3. There is a .env file which maintains the program variables that are configurable in situations where the files have different layouts,
The AWS url changes, etc...

# Build and Test
Open the python project in a python code editor.
Execute the python project and a file will be created in the root directory of the project where the code was downlaoded to containing the ouptut file results
